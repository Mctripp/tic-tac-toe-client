Tic-tac-toe game project
========================

This project uses all of the resources we have gathered from the first three weeks in the program, namely: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and bootStrap.

I started by laying out the "skeletons" of each api.js, ui.js, and events.js files for both users and games: empty functions with names describing what they do.

I proceeded by filling in each empty function with their own pseudocode to make it easier to write the code out later.

The first thing I converted from pseudocode was the HTML. It made the most sense because I would need to manipulate and format the HTML in order to test my features.

I used flexbox to setup my grid, and taking some functions from the books example that we did, I put in some forms to connect to the api.js and ui.js files later.

After I got my grid and engine working, and setup events on button clicks, I debugged my way through my page development.

Once I had my page layout and navigation set, I setup the API interactions since that is what I was the least familiar with.

I added finishing touches, such as contact info at the bottom of the page, and then debugged through any issues I was having.

I am in the process of automatically signing in after signup, allowing multiplayer, and implementing the computer AI on two different difficulties.
