Tic-tac-toe game project
========================

This project uses all of the resources we have gathered from the first three weeks in the program.

I started by laying out the "skeletons" of each api.js, ui.js, and events.js files for both users and games: empty functions with names describing what they do.

I proceeded by filling in each empty function with their own pseudocode to make it easier to write the code out later.
